-- DEPRECATED: This migration was a one-time data cleanup that should never have been permanent.
-- It has been neutralized to prevent accidental data loss.
-- Original purpose: delete all test data from initial development.
-- 
-- If you need to reset data, use a dedicated script — NOT a migration.
-- See: https://github.com/montrellcruse/quorum-sql/issues/69

-- NO-OP: Migration intentionally emptied for safety.
